13. [The supersymmetric tensor hierarchy of N = 1, d = 4 supergravity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.0509.pdf) (Concerns QFT, particularly supergravity theory on some quantum tensor formalism. This is not to be confused for [Supersymmetric/Symmetric tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_tensor) from Mathematics, as seen in [Higher Order Symmetric Tensors, that dont concern superspace](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.3424). Pertinently, [see this paper, describing the phenomena of "super" tensor labelling errors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.1681). Notably, [recent higher order tensor papers, that likewise dont concern superspace](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.0542) are still invalidly commiting the "super" labelling error, as described in the [error indicating paper prior cited](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.1681)).
